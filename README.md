# DM_Assign_Week-4

I have uploaded in 3 parts as assignment includes 3 different tasks.
I have used common dataser over the whole assignment named users_dataset.csv
I have attached the google colab files of all the work I have done.

## Part 1:

I have used colab along with D#.js for exploring visualization in doing EDA of dataset. 

In visualizations I have explored 3 visualizations and did analyse them:
1)Distribution of Ages: A histogram used to visualize the distribution of ages in the dataset.
2)Age Groups: categorized the ages into groups (e.g., 0-10, 10-20, ... , 90-100) and visualized the number of users in each age group through bar chart
3)Top Names: visualized the most common names in the dataset by pie chart

## Part 2:

I have used sweetvix eda tool for the analysis and there is a python file in which code consists of reading the csv dataset file, doing the analysis and showing it in html file over the local system. 

I have included html file in the folder along with it. 

## Part 3:

In this I have explored the mentioned apache beam features sepratley so I could understand the difference among each feature and that analysis helped me understood the concept in a better way. I have done composite transform, pipeline io, triggers, windowing, pardo. 

In last part, I have also attached the output files of it along with the colab file in each folder.
